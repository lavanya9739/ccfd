        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>This project focuses on developing a robust solution for credit card fraud detection using the Light Gradient Boosting Algorithm (LightGBM). The model analyzes transaction data to identify fraudulent activities by leveraging features such as transaction amount, time, location, and merchant details. By employing LightGBM, the solution ensures high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it suitable for handling large datasets typical of financial transactions. Built with Flask for lightweight and fast API deployment, the project provides a reliable framework for combating credit card fraud.</p>

        <h1>History of LightGBM Algorithm</h1>
        <p>LightGBM, short for Light Gradient Boosting Machine, is a breakthrough tree-based ensemble learning approach developed by researchers at Microsoft and Peking University. It was designed to overcome the efficiency and scalability challenges of XGBoost when handling high-dimensional input features and massive datasets.</p>
        <p>The LightGBM technique comprises two main innovations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB):</strong> Groups mutually exclusive features to reduce dimensionality without losing information.</li>
            <li><strong>Gradient-Based One-Side Sampling (GOSS):</strong> Focuses on instances with larger gradients, ensuring faster and more accurate learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This algorithm is based on a histogram and leaf-splitting method, which provides high speed and lower computational costs compared to other algorithms. The histogram approach reduces computation by leveraging discrete bin values to define the best split points instead of sorting all continuous feature values.</p>
        <p>Discrete bin values are also used for regularization, improving the generalizability of the model. To further enhance accuracy, leaf-splitting optimization algorithms can be applied to reduce training time. Other techniques like one-way gradient-based sampling and classification of proprietary features significantly improve the model's execution speed.</p>

            <h2>1. Speed and Efficiency</h2>
            
                <p>Histogram-based learning: LightGBM uses a histogram-based approach where continuous values are bucketed into discrete bins, making it faster than traditional gradient boosting algorithms.</p>

                <h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
                <p>Before feeding the data into a machine learning model like LightGBM, we need to preprocess the data. Here's how each feature is processed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Type (Categorical Feature):</strong> Encoded as a binary variable (e.g., Online Payment → 1, Refund → 0).</li>
                    <li><strong>Currency Code (Categorical Feature):</strong> Encoded into numerical values (e.g., INR → 0).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Country (Categorical Feature):</strong> Encoded as integers (e.g., IN → 0, US → 1).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction City (Categorical Feature):</strong> Encoded as integers (e.g., Chennai → 0, Hyderabad → 1).</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Amount (Numerical Feature):</strong> Continuous numerical value used directly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit Limit (Numerical Feature):</strong> Continuous variable used directly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Merchant Category Code (Categorical Feature):</strong> Encoded as an integer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open to Buy (Numerical Feature):</strong> Continuous variable used directly.</li>
                </ul>No code was selected, so I will provide a general improvement to the code. Here's an improved version of the HTML structure with added accessibility features and semantic elements:
